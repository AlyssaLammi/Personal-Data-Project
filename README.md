# Personal-Data-Project

## Motivation
When I started this project, I wanted to see what the difference between men's and women's pay was in STEM. Which is what motivated me to choose this dataset because it contains the average median pay for men and women arcoss a variety of fields. I choose with this dataset instead of choosing a strictly STEM pay focused dataset because I thought that it would be more interesting (and I simply just got curious when I stumbeled upon this dataset) to see what the pay gap was like across more than just STEM. In school, whenever a pay gap does get mentioned, it is always STEM focused and I wanted to go beyond that and show that, in general, women are paid less than men no matter the field. 

## Data Process


## Visualization

### Figure
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlyssaLammi/Personal-Data-Project/main/Median%20Earnings%20for%20Men%20vs%20Women%20Graph.png">
Caption: This figure shows how, in general, men are paid more across all of the fields in the dataset than women are. Though, it is also important because it shows how the average median pay for women caps out at about $70,000 while there is not the same kind of limit or cap on the average median pay of men.
